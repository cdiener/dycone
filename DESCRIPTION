Title: dycone - create the dynamic landscape from metabolome data
Version: 0.5
Authors@R: person("Christian", "Diener", , "ch.diener@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Dycone allows you to analyze space of kinetic activities of a 
	biochemical system by using metabolome data (for instance from mass 
	spectometry). Its main applications is the discovery of enzyme activities
	that are differentially regulated between a normal and disease state.
