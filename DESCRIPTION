Package: dycone
Title: dycone - create the dynamic landscape from metabolome data
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Christian", "Diener", , "ch.diener@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Dycone allows you to analyze the dynamic landscape of a metabolic system 
	without knowing its kinetic parameters. It uses steady state and dynamic metabolome data 
	(for instance by ion trap experiments) for that.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
