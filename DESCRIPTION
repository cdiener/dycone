Title: dycone - analyze the dynamic landscape of metabolome data
Version: 0.8
Authors@R: person("Christian", "Diener", , "ch.diener@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Dycone ("dynamic cone") allows you infer enzymatic regulation from 
    metabolome mesurements. It employs formalisms based on flux and k-cone 
    analysis to connect metabolome data to distinct regulations of enzyme activity. 
    Most of the analysis methods can be applied to genome-scale data. 
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
