Package: dycone
Title: dycone - analyze the dynamic landscape of metabolome data
Version: 1.4.1
Authors@R: person("Christian", "Diener", , "work@cdiener.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Dycone ("dynamic cone") allows you infer enzymatic regulation from
    metabolome measurements. It employs formalisms based on flux and k-cone analysis
    to connect metabolome data to distinct regulations of enzyme activity. Most of
    the analysis methods can be applied to genome-scale data.
